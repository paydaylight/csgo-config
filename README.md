## Introduction

This is my [config](#autoexeccfg), [launch-options](#launch-options) and [grenade binds for training](#grenades-training) that I use in CS:GO

## Autoexec.cfg

* binds specific greandes to specific keys
* binds increase crosshair size for smoke lineups (note that ```5``` corresponds to my initial crosshair size) to ```C```
* binds a jump throw to ```V```
* binds jump to ```MHEELUP```, ```MWHEELDOWN``` and ```space```

To make it work just copy ```autoexec.cfg``` to ```csgo/cfg``` folder

## Grenades training

Copy contents of ```./grenades``` to a CS:GO console upon starting a map

* activates ```sv_cheats``` and adds training stuff like grenade trajectory, increased time, infinite ammo, and etc.
* binds noclip to ```P```
* binds getting all grenades to ```H```

## Launch options

Set from Steam menu

```-tickrate 128 +fps_max 0 -novid -nojoy```
